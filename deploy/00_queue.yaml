  # CRITICAL: This queue name MUST be different from the verifier's default_queue.
  # During plugin installation, a 4-party TSS reshare occurs with:
  #   1. User's CLI
  #   2. Fast Vault Server
  #   3. Verifier Worker (listens on "default_queue")
  #   4. DCA Plugin Worker (listens on this queue)
  #
  # If both workers share the same queue, the reshare fails because both
  # reshare tasks get picked up by the same worker type.
  #
  # See CLAUDE.md "Queue Isolation" section for details.
